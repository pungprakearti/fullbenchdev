        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHi, I'm Andrew. I just got accepted into Rithm School's eighth 
        cohort. I'm super excited to learn how to create web applications and become a solid 
        coder. Follow this page to see my progress through the course and with my new career.

      <div id="about" class="content">
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI'm half of Lead Money Games, an independent game development 
        company.  On June 15, 2016 we were funded through Kickstarter and on April 4, 2017 
        we launched our first game on Steam called Lil Tanks.  It's a little shoot 'em up 
        game that was purely engineered through trial and error and lots of online 
        tutorials.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter a few years of game development, I decided it's time for me 
        to throw myself into full fledged software engineering.  I've always loved the 
        intersection of computers and art and I'm excited to see where this takes me.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI also freelance as a digital effects artist having worked on over 
        forty films. This is a vestige of my former life working in the film industry for 10 
        years.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn my free time, you can usually find me on a hockey rink. I play 
        ice and roller hockey all over the Bay Area and Sonoma County. If I can continue to pay 
        league fees, I am happy.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy family life consists of my amazing wife Samantha, and my two 
        adorable children: Theo and Violet.
